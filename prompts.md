Write a Bash script to automate the Laravel application development process, specifically focusing on creating models with a standard template. The script should be able to:

1. Take inputs via flags or user prompts to specify the model name, table name, and any additional attributes.
2. Create a base model template if it does not already exist.
3. Generate a new model file based on the base template, incorporating the provided model name, table name, and attributes.
4. Ensure the generated model follows Laravel conventions and best practices.

The script should handle the following flags and inputs:
- `-m` or `--model`: Name of the model to be created.
- `-t` or `--table`: Name of the table associated with the model.
- `-a` or `--attributes`: Comma-separated list of attributes for the model.

If flags are not provided, the script should prompt the user for the necessary information.

Here's an example of how the script should work:
1. If the base model template does not exist, create it with the necessary structure.
2. Prompt the user or read flags for the model name, table name, and attributes.
3. Generate the model file using the base template and populate it with the specified details.

Make sure the script is robust, handles errors gracefully, and provides helpful output messages to the user.

### Example Usage

```sh
./generate_model.sh -m User -t users -a name,email,password
Or interactively:
./generate_model.sh
And then the script will prompt:
Enter model name: User
Enter table name: users
Enter attributes (comma-separated): name,email,password

### Expected Bash Script Output

The Bash script should create a new model file in the `app/Models` directory with the provided details, based on a standard Laravel model template.

---------------------------
Write a Bash script to automate the creation of migration files based on a given model in a Laravel application. The script should be able to:

1. Take inputs via flags or user prompts to specify the model name, table name, and any additional attributes.
2. Create a migration file with the appropriate Laravel artisan command, incorporating the provided model name, table name, and attributes.
3. Ensure the generated migration file follows Laravel conventions and best practices.

The script should handle the following flags and inputs:
- `-m` or `--model`: Name of the model for which the migration is being created.
- `-t` or `--table`: Name of the table associated with the model.
- `-a` or `--attributes`: Comma-separated list of attributes for the table.

If flags are not provided, the script should prompt the user for the necessary information.

Here's an example of how the script should work:
1. Prompt the user or read flags for the model name, table name, and attributes.
2. Generate the migration file using the Laravel artisan command and populate it with the specified details.

Make sure the script is robust, handles errors gracefully, and provides helpful output messages to the user.

### Example Usage

```sh
./generate_migration.sh -m User -t users -a name:string,email:string,password:string
Or interactively:
./generate_migration.sh
Enter model name: User
Enter table name: users
Enter attributes (comma-separated, format: name:type): name:string,email:string,password:string

### Expected Bash Script Output

The Bash script should create a new migration file in the `database/migrations` directory with the provided details, based on a standard Laravel migration template.

------------migration prompt
Write a Bash script to automate the creation of migration files for a Laravel application. The script should:

1. Read all models in the `app/Models` directory.
2. Provide the user with an option to choose from all available models, using a comma-separated numeric representation.
3. Check if a migration class already exists for the chosen model(s). If it exists, the script should throw an error and exit, mentioning that the migration already exists.
4. Ask for user input with options for each model class:
   - 1: Standard migration
   - 2: Model-based migration
   - 3: Custom migration

For each option:
- **Standard:** Create a basic migration.
- **Model-based:** Read from model attributes (table name, casts) and use the table name as the database table. Use cast keys as column names and cast values as column datatypes.
- **Custom:** Prompt the user to input the table name, column names, and types in a comma-separated format (name:type).

Make sure the script handles errors gracefully and provides helpful output messages to the user.

### Example Usage

```sh
./generate_migration.sh
The script should:

List all models and prompt the user to choose models using numeric representation.
Check if migration files already exist for the chosen models.
Based on the user's choice, create the appropriate migration files.
Expected Bash Script Output
The Bash script should create new migration files in the database/migrations directory, following the specified type (standard, model-based, custom) for each selected model.

Example Script Flow
List models:
1. User
2. Product
3. Order
Enter the numbers of the models you want to create migrations for, separated by commas: 1,3
Check for existing migrations and prompt for each model:
Model: User
Migration type (1: Standard, 2: Model-based, 3: Custom): 2
...
Model: Order
Migration type (1: Standard, 2: Model-based, 3: Custom): 3
Enter table name: orders
Enter columns (comma-separated, format: name:type): id:bigint,amount:decimal

This prompt provides detailed instructions for generating a Bash script that automates the migration creation process based on user-selected models and migration types. If you need any further adjustments or additional features, please let me know!


---------------Project

Write a Bash script to list the project directory and file structure of a Laravel application. The script should exclude Laravel-provided files, the vendor directory, and other boilerplate files. Additionally, the script should provide useful statistics about the project.

### Requirements:
1. **Directory and File Listing:**
   - List all directories and files in the project.
   - Exclude Laravel boilerplate files, the vendor directory, and other irrelevant files.
   - Display the directory and file structure in a tree format.

2. **Statistics:**
   - Count the number of custom models, controllers, migrations, and views.
   - Display the total number of lines of code for custom files.
   - Show the size of the project directory excluding vendor and boilerplate files.

3. **Exclusions:**
   - Laravel boilerplate files (e.g., default controllers, migrations, views).
   - Vendor directory.
   - Node modules directory (if applicable).
   - Configuration files that are not custom.

### Example Usage:

```sh
./list_project_structure.sh
#Example output

├── app
│   ├── Models
│   │   ├── CustomModel1.php
│   │   └── CustomModel2.php

│   │   ├── Controllers
│   │   │   ├── CustomController1.php
│   │   │   └── CustomController2.php
├── database
│   ├── migrations
│   │   ├── 2023_01_01_000001_create_custom_table1.php
│   │   └── 2023_01_01_000002_create_custom_table2.php
├── resources
│   ├── views
│   │   ├── custom_view1.blade.php
│   │   └── custom_view2.blade.php

Statistics:
- Custom Models: 2
- Custom Controllers: 2
- Custom Migrations: 2
- Custom Views: 2
- Total Lines of Code (Custom Files): 1500
- Project Size (Excluding Vendor and Boilerplate Files): 10MB
Detailed Instructions:
Directory Listing:

Use find or tree command to list the directory structure.
Use grep or similar commands to exclude boilerplate files and directories.
Statistics Gathering:

Count custom models, controllers, migrations, and views using find and wc commands.
Calculate the total number of lines of code using wc -l on custom files.
Calculate the project size using du command, excluding vendor and boilerplate files.
Output Formatting:

Display the directory structure in a tree format.
Provide statistics in a clear, easy-to-read format.
